Q. What new skills have you learned?

A. I've learned what HTML is.  Its syntax and how to serve it up in the browser.  When there is a problem the resources available to solve the problem.  Finally, and most importantly, how to properly ask a question concerning HTML in order to efficiently leverage those resources.



Q. What has been easy?

A. HTML syntax has been the easiest.



Q. What has been difficult?

A. Translation of certain terms, such as drawing a line vs. adding a horizontal rule.



Q. How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

A. See above answer as I missed the hint on the horizontal rule.  Google and Stack Overflow were useful in pointing me to the correct area in MDN for the horizontal rule tag.
